<p>After U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. falsely claimed in September that Tylenol causes autism spectrum disorder, it‚Äôs more important than ever to dispel long-standing myths about this misunderstood condition. While research and attention have largely focused on children with autism, adults‚Äîespecially those diagnosed later in life‚Äîreceive far less care and understanding. Many have turned to TikTok to share their experiences, challenge stereotypes, and find community support. </p>
<br>
<p>Though this online space offers valuable connection, it cannot replace the critical research still lacking for autistic adults. Funding continues to favor childhood diagnosis and genetics, leaving major gaps in evidence-based treatments, long-term outcomes, and support for independence, health, and daily living. Kennedy‚Äôs promotion of debunked pseudoscience diverts attention and resources from these urgent needs. Redirecting research toward adults with autism could greatly improve their employment, relationships, and quality of life.</p>

    <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Autistic adults cannot succeed professionally.<br><strong>
        <br>Truth:</strong> Autism does not prevent individuals from thriving in the workforce, yet the lack of proper support and accommodations has severely limited employment opportunities. According to the <a href="https://autismsociety.org/employment/#:~:text=Employment%20Statistics,1%20in%2031" target=blank>Autism Society,</a>
       up to 85% of autistic adults with a college degree are unemployed or underemployed. A 2021 study published in the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28211841/#:~:text=Results:%20Of%20the%20254%20adults,significant%20predictor%20of%20employment%20status." target=blank>National Library of Medicine </a> similarly found an unemployment rate of around 40% among adults with autism. The Autism Society also reports that autistic adults typically earn about 40% less than peers with other disabilities, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that only 19.3% of people with disabilities were employed in 2020. These disparities stem from barriers such as interview difficulties, social and sensory challenges, and a lack of workplace accommodationss. Moreover, only about 30% of autistic employees disclose their diagnosis to employers, often fearing discrimination.

    <p><strong>Myth:</strong>If you're "high-functioning," autism doesn't impact your life: <br>
        <strong><br>Truth:</strong>The term "high-functioning autism" is now considered outdated and misleading, as it overlooks the significant and often unseen challenges faced by autistic individuals with fewer support needs. A 2020 study in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8992917/#:~:text=What%20did%20we%20find?,that%20it%20helped%20them%20too." target=blank>"Autism in Adulthood"</a>found that many of these individuals use substantial energy to appear neurotypical in social settings‚Äîa behavior known as ‚Äúmasking‚Äù or ‚Äúcamouflaging‚Äù‚Äîwhich can result in burnout, anxiety, and depression. A survey of 420 autistic adults conducted by the Autism Self Advocacy Network found that 89% of respondents who would previously have been labeled ‚Äúhigh-functioning‚Äù reported experiencing significant daily challenges that were invisible to others, particularly in areas of sensory processing, executive functioning, and emotional regulation.

        <strong>Myth:</strong> Autism is a new phenomenon in adults <br>
        <strong><br>Truth:</strong>Autism is not new; Autism has existed throughout history, but increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria have led to more adults being diagnosed today. Although first clinically described in the 1940s, historical records show people with autistic traits long before that. What‚Äôs changed is not autism itself, but our ability to recognize and understand it. A 2019 study published in the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3601822/#:~:text=community%20psychiatric%20diagnoses.-,Results,60%25%20having%20two%20or%20more." target=blank>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders </a>reviewed early 20th-century psychiatric records and found that around 6% of patients would meet today‚Äôs criteria for autism spectrum disorder, although they were diagnosed with other conditions at the time.
